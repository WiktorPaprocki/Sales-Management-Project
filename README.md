## Business Request & User Stories
The business request for this data analyst project was an executive sales report for sales managers. 
Based on the request that was made from the business we following user stories were defined to fulfill delivery and ensure that acceptance criteriaâ€™s were maintained throughout the project.

## SQL Data Cleaning, Transformation and Exploration (SQL Data Exploration.sql, SQL table queries.sql files)
To create the necessary data model for doing analysis and fulfilling the business needs defined in the user stories the following tables were extracted using SQL:
- Dim_Products,
- Dim_Customer,
- Fact_Internet_Sales
One data source (sales budgets) were provided in Excel format and were connected in the data model in a later step of the process.
<br /> I also explored the data and made a preliminary analysis in MS SQL Server.

## Power BI Dashboard (Sales Dashboard 1.pbix)
Connected to MS SQL Server and imported necessary tables into Power BI and created relationships which are shown on the screenshot below
<br /> Created Calendar Table and changed data types to proper ones
