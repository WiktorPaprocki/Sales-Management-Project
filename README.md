## Excel Data Cleaning - (Dim_Customer - data cleaning.xlsx)
Cleaned Dim_Customer table in Microsoft Excel:
- removed unnecessary columns
- checked if there was any duplicates in table - no duplciates found
- replaced M to Married and S to Single in MaritalStatus column
- Replaced M to Male and F to Female in Gender column
- imported DimCustomerCleaned table into MS SQL Server


## SQL Data Cleansing, Transformation and Exploration (SQL Data Exploration.sql, SQL table queries.sql files)
To create the necessary data model for doing analysis and fulfilling the business needs defined in the user stories the following tables were extracted using SQL:
- Dim_Calendar,
- Dim_Products,
- Dim_Customer,
- Fact_Internet_Sales
One data source (sales budgets) were provided in Excel format and were connected in the data model in a later step of the process.
I also explored the data and made a preliminary analysis in MS SQL Server.

## Power BI Dashboard (Sales Dashboard 1.pbix)
Imported necessary tables into Power BI and created relationships which are shown on the screenshot below
